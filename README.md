### 1. Is Java Platform Independent if then how?
Yes, Java is a Platform Independent language. Unlike many programming languages javac compiler compiles the program to form a bytecode or .class file. This file is independent of the software or hardware running but needs a JVM(Java Virtual Machine) the bytecode can be created on any System and can be executed in any other system despite hardware or software being used which makes Java platform independent.
### 2. What are the top Java Features?
there are many features in Java that makes it better than any other languages some of them are
1. Simple
2. Platform Independent
3. Interpreted as well as Compile language
4. Robust
5. Object-Oriented
6. Secured
7. Dynamic
8. Multithreaded
And many more.
### 3. What is JVM?
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine it is a Java interpreter. It is responsible for loading, verifying, and executing the bytecode created in Java.
### 4. What are Memory storages available with JVM?
JVM consists of a few memory storages as mentioned below:
1. Class Area: stores class level data of every class such as method data and the codes for mthods.
2. Heap: Objects are created or obbjec
3. Stack:
4. Program Counter Register:
5. Native Method Stack:
### 5. What is a classloader?
Classloader is the part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment), during the execution of the bytecode or created .class file classloader is responsible for dynamically loading the java classes and interfaces to JVM(Java Virtual Machine). 
### 6. Difference between JVM, JRE, and JDK
JVM: JVM also known as Java Virtual Machine is a part of JRE. JVM is a type of interpreter responsible for converting bytecode into machine-readable code. JVM itself is platform dependent but it interprets the bytecode which is the platform-independent reason why Java is platform-independent. 

JRE: JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment, it is an installation package that provides an environment to run the Java program or application on any machine.

JDK: JDK stands for Java Development Kit which provides the environment to develop and execute Java programs. JDK is a package that includes two things Development Tools to provide an environment to develop your Java programs and, JRE to execute Java programs or applications.
